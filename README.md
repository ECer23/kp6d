## Pipeline

### Keypoints Designation

Go to folder [gendata](./gendata) and follow its instructions. After this step, you'll get models and keypoints raw data (in .ply format).

### Object Detector

Go to folder [detect](./detect) and follow its instructions. After this step, you'll get pre-trained weights for LINEMOD.

### Keypoint Localization
